# AI-vs-Real-Image-analysis
In this project I have used openCV and deep learning algorithms to generate a CNN model for predicting the images whether they are AI-generated or real images.
Prediction Accuracy reaches up to 79% of the model there is no sign of overfitting and the model is successfully predicting between AI-generated and Real Art pictures.
